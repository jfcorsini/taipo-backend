# nameless-language-app

This is the repository where I will add code related to a message-based app to help learning a language. This is still in early stage of development.

To this particular moment, this will be the codebase for the backend.

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [NodeJS 8.10+ installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)

## Ideas to implement:

* Always improve development flow.
